GitHub Actions is a tool by GitHub to automate building, testing and deployment of code.

Surge is a simple tool for publishing static websites for free, by only running a single command.

In this post, I have written the steps you can follow to deploy a react app to surge.sh using GitHub actions.

What we need:
A React application. create
A GitHub repository. create
A Surge deploy token.
Get surge deploy token
npm install surge
surge
Enter username/email and password to login.
Then run surge token to generate token.
Copy this token and add it as a secret in the GitHub repository.

Setup GitHub Actions
GitHub actions are triggered by yaml files in .github/workflows/ directory. Create a yaml file in this directory and add these lines.
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2-beta
      with:
          node-version: 12

    - name: Build React App
      run: |
        npm install # Install Dependencies
        CI=false npm run build # CI=false to ignore warnings

    - name: Install Surge
      run: npm install -g surge

    - name: Deploy to Surge
      run:  surge ./build https://someawsomeurl.surge.sh/ --token ${{secrets.SURGE_TOKEN}}
